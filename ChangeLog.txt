Change Log
==========

vs. Contributed code base: xtc_v2.3.1-core (2012-04-04)
    which (with respect to the Rats tool) has not changed since xtc_v2.2.0-core (2011-11-19)

CR001 Remove all files not required by or related to the Rats! packrat parser generator. 
      Create Netbeans project infrastructure.

CR002 Require a (not generated) abstract class AbstractParser within same package as the
      generated parser class. For this purpose the later has been changed to extend 
      AbstractParser instead of xtc.parser.ParserBase.
      This is useful for inserting a customizable class under the developers control 
      between the generated parser class and class ParserBase provided by Rats, effectively
      decoupling the generated parser from ParserBase.
      Changes in: xtc.parser.CodeGenerator
      
CR003 Make top-level parsing methods "public final" instead of just "public"
      Changes in: xtc.parser.CodeGenerator
      
CR004 Remove timestamp from from header comment of generated parser class because it forces a 
      useless new svn version on every generation run absent substancial changes.
