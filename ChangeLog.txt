Change Log
==========

vs. Contributed code base: xtc_v2.3.1-core (2012-04-04)
    which (with respect to the Rats tool) has not changed since xtc_v2.2.0-core (2011-11-19)

CR002 Require a (not generated) abstract class AbstractParser within same package as the
      generated parser class, which has been changed to extend AbstractParser instead of
      ParserBase.
      This is useful for inserting a customizable class under the developers control 
      between the generated parser class and class ParserBase provided by Rats, effectively
      decoupling the generated parser from ParserBase.
      Changes in: xtc.parser.CodeGenerator
      
CR003 Make top-level parsing methods "public final" instead of just "public"
      Changes in: xtc.parser.CodeGenerator
      
CR004 Remove timestamp from from header comment of generated parser because it forces a 
      useless new svn version on every generation run absent substancial changes.
