Change Log
==========

vs. Contributed code base: xtc_v2.4.0-core (2014-08-17)
    which has not changed (much) since xtc_v2.2.0-core (2011-11-19) with respect to the Rats tool.

CR001 Remove all files not required by or related to the Rats! packrat parser generator itself. 
      Remove make-files and create Ant-based Netbeans project infrastructure.

CR002 Require a (statically defined, i.e. not generated) abstract class AbstractParser within 
      same package as the generated parser class. For this purpose the later has been changed to extend AbstractParser instead of xtc.parser.ParserBase
      This is useful for inserting a customizable class under the developers control 
      between the generated parser class and class ParserBase provided by the Rats runtime,
      effectively decoupling the generated parser from ParserBase.
      Changes in: xtc.parser.CodeGenerator
      
CR003 Make top-level parsing methods "public final" instead of just "public"
      Changes in: xtc.parser.CodeGenerator
      
CR004 Remove timestamp from from header comment of generated parser class because it forces a 
      useless new scc version on every generation run absent substancial changes.

Mavenize project.

Split original codebase into generator and runtime module.

Correct javadoc errors.

Correct documentation errors.
