## About

This is a modified version of [Rats!](http://cs.nyu.edu/rgrimm/xtc/rats-intro.html) - 
a Java Packrat Parser generator - published by [Robert Grim](http://cs.nyu.edu/rgrimm/) as part of his 
[xtc](http://cs.nyu.edu/rgrimm/xtc/) (eXTensible Compiler) project.

Our code is based on version 2.3.1 (2012-04-04) of Rats!, which we have obtained from 
[here](http://cs.nyu.edu/rgrimm/xtc/#distribution). All changes made to the original code base will be listed in 
[ChangeLog.txt](https://github.com/km-works/kmw-rats/blob/master/ChangeLog.txt). 
Both the original software and our modifications are licensed under a GPL2 License. For details see

## Purpose

The purpose of this project is to enhance the runtime architecture of the Java packrat parser generated by Rats!. 
The problem with the original version is, that all generated parser code is thrown into a single Java class file. 
For large grammars this can lead to an unmanagable size of the generated parser source. For example, Project Fortress, 
one of the more prominent users of Rats!, generates a 2MB parser source file! With some IDEs your have problems with
just opening this file in the editor.

On the other hand Rats! already supports modular grammar definitions, in fact one of its distinguishing strengths. So 
why, we have asked ourselfs, not leverage this capabilities also for the runtime architecure, and divide the generated 
code into manageable parser modules too?
