## About

This is a slightly modified and modernized fork of [Rats!](http://cs.nyu.edu/rgrimm/xtc/rats-intro.html) - 
a Java Packrat Parser generator - published by [Robert Grim](http://cs.nyu.edu/rgrimm/) as part of his 
[xtc](http://cs.nyu.edu/rgrimm/xtc/) (eXTensible Compiler) project.

Our code is based on version 2.4.0 (2014-08-17) of Rats!, which we have obtained from 
[here](http://cs.nyu.edu/rgrimm/xtc/#distribution). All changes made to this original codebase are listed in 
[ChangeLog.txt](https://github.com/km-works/kmw-rats/blob/master/ChangeLog.txt).
