    <p>Grammars
      for&nbsp;<i>Rats!</i>&nbsp;build
      on the Parsing Expression Grammar (PEG) formalism described in Brian
      Ford's&nbsp;<a  href="http://www.brynosaurus.com/pub/lang/peg.pdf">Parsing
        Expression Grammars</a>&nbsp;paper.
      However, since&nbsp;<i>Rats!</i>&nbsp;produces working parsers,
      the syntax of&nbsp;<i>Rats!</i>&nbsp;grammars is somewhat
      different from and more expressive than the PEG syntax described in the
      paper. Additionally, to make grammars more easily reusable and extensible,&nbsp;<i>Rats</i> organizes
      grammar fragments into modules. A good starting point for learning how to
      use&nbsp;<i>Rats!</i>, in
      addition to this introduction, are&nbsp;<i>Rats!</i>'
      own grammar in package&nbsp;<code>xtc.parser</code>&nbsp;and the C and Java grammars
      in package&nbsp;<code>xtc.lang</code>.</p>

    <h4>Overview
      of Expressions and Operators</h4>
    <span>The
      biggest difference between parsing expression grammars and the more
      familiar context-free grammars (CFGs) is the use of&nbsp;</span><i>ordered</i><span>&nbsp;choices instead of symmetric
      choices. Hence, the different options in a PEG choice (and also a&nbsp;</span><i>Rats!</i><span>&nbsp;choice) are separated by a
      slash&nbsp;</span><code>/</code><span>&nbsp;instead of a vertical bar&nbsp;</span><code>|</code><span>.
      Furthermore, to emphasize that PEGs define how to&nbsp;</span><i>parse</i><span>&nbsp;a language instead of how to
      generate a language, PEGs use a left arrow&nbsp;</span><code>&lt;-</code><span>&nbsp;instead of the right arrow&nbsp;</span><code>-&gt;</code><span>&nbsp;used in CFGs. Note that&nbsp;</span><i>Rats!</i><span>&nbsp;uses an equal sign instead.</span>
    <p>Otherwise,
      PEGs have many of the same expressions and operators as other syntax and
      grammar formalisms. For example, the any character constant&nbsp;<code>.</code>&nbsp;(<code>_</code>&nbsp;for&nbsp;<i>Rats!</i>) matches any
      character in the input, and a character class, as defined by the&nbsp;<code>[]</code>&nbsp;operator, matches any of the
      characters in the class. The option operator&nbsp;<code>?</code>&nbsp;makes an expression
      optional, and the star&nbsp;<code>*</code>&nbsp;and plus&nbsp;<code>+</code>&nbsp;operators indicate
      zero-or-more and one-or-more repetitions, respectively. Somewhat less
      common are the and&nbsp;<code>&amp;</code>&nbsp;and not&nbsp;<code>!</code>&nbsp;operators, which denote
      syntactic predicates. Expressions in a syntactic predicate must match (for
      the and&nbsp;<code>&amp;</code>&nbsp;operator) or not match (for
      the not&nbsp;<code>!</code>&nbsp;operator) the input, though
      the corresponding text in the input is&nbsp;<i>not</i>&nbsp;consumed.</p>
    <p><i>Rats!</i>&nbsp;grammars differ from PEGs in
      that they have additional expressions and operators necessary for
      generating actual parsers. Most importantly,&nbsp;<i>Rats!</i>&nbsp;grammars include&nbsp;<i>actions</i>&nbsp;that generate semantic
      values. Actions are surrounded by curly brackets&nbsp;<code>{}</code>,
      just like blocks of code in C, C++, or Java. To access such semantic
      values,&nbsp;<i>Rats!</i>&nbsp;grammars can also include&nbsp;<i>bindings</i>. Bindings
      first specify the variable name, followed by a colon&nbsp;<code>:</code>,
      and then the expression to be bound. Additionally,&nbsp;<i>Rats!</i>&nbsp;grammars support&nbsp;<i>semantic
        predicates</i>, which are denoted by the and&nbsp;<code>&amp;</code>&nbsp;operator directly followed
      by an action (which must be an expression evaluating to a boolean value).
      Furthermore,&nbsp;<i>Rats!</i>&nbsp;grammars support&nbsp;<i>text
        matching expressions</i>, which first specify the text to be matched as
      a string literal, followed by a colon&nbsp;<code>:</code>,
      and then the expression to be matched. A text matching expression</p>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<code>"</code><i>text</i><code>":</code><i>expr</i></p>
    <p>is
      equivalent to the expression</p>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>fresh-variable</i><code>:</code><i>expr</i><code>&nbsp;&amp;{&nbsp;"</code><i>text</i><code>".equals(</code><i>fresh-variable</i><code>)&nbsp;}</code></p>
    <p>but
      implemented more efficiently.&nbsp;<i>Rats!</i>&nbsp;grammars also support a&nbsp;<i>voiding operator</i>,
      which is specified as "<code>void:</code>" followed by an expression,&nbsp;<i>node markers</i>, which
      are specified as an at sign '<code>@</code>' immediately followed by an
      identifier, and&nbsp;<i>parser
        actions</i>, which are actions prefixed by a caret '<code>^</code>'.
      Voided expressions and node markers help with the automatic generation of
      abstract syntax trees and are explained&nbsp;<a

         href="#generic">here</a>.
      Parser actions provide a low-level interface for extending parsers
      generated by&nbsp;<i>Rats!</i>&nbsp;and are explained&nbsp;<a

         href="#parser-actions">here</a>.</p>
    <p>Other
      differences between PEGs and&nbsp;<i>Rats!</i>&nbsp;grammars include that, as
      already mentioned&nbsp;<i>Rats!</i>&nbsp;uses an underscore '<code>_</code>'
      as the any character constant, while PEGs use a dot '<code>.</code>'.
      Furthermore,&nbsp;<i>Rats!</i>,
      just like C/C++/Java, requires that single-quoted literals specify exactly
      one character, while double-quoted literals may specify an arbitrary
      number of characters. Escape sequences include basic C/C++/Java escapes
      such as '<code>\n</code>' and '<code>\\</code>', Java Unicode escapes such
      as '<code>\u00ff</code>', and '<code>\[</code>', '<code>\-</code>', and '<code>\]</code>'
      for character class specifications.&nbsp;<i>Rats!</i>&nbsp;grammars also use standard
      C/C++/Java comments. Note that, while&nbsp;<i>Rats!</i>supports
      Unicode, it only supports 16 bit characters in the basic multilingual
      plane (i.e., with code points between U+0000 and U+FFFF). Expressions
      recognizing supplementary characters (i.e., with code points between
      U+10000 and U+10FFFF) need to use&nbsp;<a

         href="http://java.sun.com/developer/technicalArticles/Intl/Supplementary/">Java's
        encoding</a>&nbsp;as a pair
      of&nbsp;<code>char</code>&nbsp;values in the surrogates
      range.<a  name="modules"></a></p>
    <h4>Grammar
      Modules</h4>
    <span>A&nbsp;</span><i>Rats!</i><span>&nbsp;grammar consists of one
      top-level module, which is the module specified on the command line when
      invoking&nbsp;</span><i>Rats!</i><span>,
      and zero or more dependent modules. Each module starts with several
      declarations, whose syntax follows from&nbsp;</span><code>Intro</code><span>&nbsp;in the&nbsp;</span><i>Rats!</i><span>&nbsp;syntax specification&nbsp;</span><a

       href="#syntax">above</a><span>:</span>
    <ul>
      <li>The&nbsp;<code>module</code>&nbsp;declaration specifies the
        fully qualified name of a grammar module. Optionally, the module may
        have one or more parameters, which are treated as module names and are
        replaced with the actual arguments throughout the module, notably in
        module dependency declarations and in qualified nonterminals (a
        qualified nonterminal consists of the module name, followed by a dot '<code>.</code>',
        followed by the unqualified nonterminal). Module parameters are
        discussed in more detail&nbsp;<a

           href="#parameters">here</a>.</li>
      <li>Zero or more module dependency declarations specify how the current
        module depends on other modules.&nbsp;<i>Rats!</i>&nbsp;supports three types of
        such dependency declarations. First, import dependencies make another
        module's nonterminals referenceable from within the current module.
        Second, modification dependencies make another module's productions
        available for modification in the current module. Each module can have
        at most one modification dependency. Finally, instantiation dependencies
        instantiate other modules (typically, modules that require arguments)
        and make their names available for use in other dependencies. The
        effects of import and instantiation declarations are discussed in more
        detail&nbsp;<a  href="#parameters">here</a>;
        module modifications are discussed in detail&nbsp;<a

           href="#modifications">here</a>.</li>
      <li>The action code following an optional&nbsp;<code>header</code>&nbsp;declaration is copied into
        the parser just before the parser class declaration. If a grammar spans
        several modules, all unique header actions are copied into the parser
        class.</li>
      <li>The action code following an optional&nbsp;<code>body</code>&nbsp;declaration is copied into
        the body of the parser class. Again, if a grammar spans several modules,
        all unique body actions are copied into the parser class.</li>
      <li>The action code following an optional&nbsp;<code>footer</code>&nbsp;declaration is copied just
        after the parser class declaration. As for header and body declarations,
        if a grammar spans several modules, all unique footer actions are copied
        into the parser class.</li>
      <li>An optional&nbsp;<code>option</code>&nbsp;declaration specifies
        parser options. Each option is expressed as an attribute, which is an
        identifier specifying the attribute's name followed by an optional
        integer literal, qualified name, or string within parentheses&nbsp;<code>()</code>&nbsp;specifying the attribute's
        value. The currently recognized options are discussed&nbsp;<a

           href="#attributes">here</a>.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>A
      grammar's top-level module (i.e., the module specified on the command line
      when invoking&nbsp;<i>Rats!</i>)
      is treated somewhat differently from its dependent modules:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>By default, the Java package and class names of the generated parser
        are automatically deduced from the fully qualified name of the top-level
        module. For example, the default package and class names for module&nbsp;<code>xtc.parser.PGrammar</code>&nbsp;would be&nbsp;<code>xtc.parser</code>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<code>PGrammar</code>,
        respectively. However, this default can be overriden through the&nbsp;<a

           href="#parser-attribute"><code>parser</code></a>&nbsp;option (and is, in fact,
        overriden by that module).</li>
      <li>Option declarations are outside the module system, and only the
        top-level module's options are observed by the parser generator. The
        exceptions are the following options. First, the&nbsp;<a

           href="#stateful-attribute"><code>stateful</code></a>option
        specifies a global state object and must have the same value across all
        of a grammar's modules (if it appears at all). Second, the&nbsp;<a

           href="#set"><code>setOfString</code></a>&nbsp;option specifies a global
        set of strings and has the corresponding field's name as its value; each
        unique value results in its own global field. Finally the&nbsp;<a

           href="#flag"><code>flag</code></a>&nbsp;option specifies a global
        boolean field and has the corresponding field's name as its value; each
        unique value results in its own global field.</li>
      <li>The top-level module must have at least one production that is marked
        as&nbsp;<a  href="#public-attribute"><code>public</code></a>,
        which indicates that that production is a top-level production and thus
        visible outside the parser class. Other modules' public productions are
        not treated as top-level production for the grammar.</li>
      <li>Finally, because the top-level module is directly instantiated, it
        cannot have any parameters. Only dependent modules may have parameters;
        the corresponding arguments are specified when importing, instantiating,
        or modifying the module.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Similar
      to the Java compiler automatically loading dependent Java classes,&nbsp;<i>Rats!</i>&nbsp;automatically loads
      dependent modules from the file system. For example, when looking for the
      dependent module<code>xtc.util.Spacing</code>,&nbsp;<i>Rats!</i>&nbsp;searches for the file&nbsp;<code>xtc/util/Spacing.rats</code>&nbsp;on Unix-like systems. One or
      more root directories for this search can be specified through the&nbsp;<code>-in</code>&nbsp;command line option.</p>
    <p>A
      grammar's modules can be visualized by using&nbsp;<i>Rats!</i>'&nbsp;<code>-html</code>&nbsp;command
      line option combined with either the&nbsp;<code>-instantiated</code>,&nbsp;<code>-applied</code>, or&nbsp;<code>-processed</code>&nbsp;command line option to
      specify the stage of&nbsp;<i>Rats!</i>'
      processing. In all three cases,&nbsp;<i>Rats!</i>&nbsp;creates a hyperlinked
      version of the grammar at that processing stage. Make sure that the&nbsp;<a

         href="http://cs.nyu.edu/rgrimm/xtc/grammar.css"><code>grammar.css</code></a>&nbsp;stylesheet is in the same
      directory as the generated HTML file(s). The output directory can be
      controlled with the&nbsp;<code>-out</code>&nbsp;command line option.<a  name="values"></a></p>
    <h4>Productions
      and Semantic Values</h4>
    <span>After
      the module declarations follow the productions, with each production
      defining how to parse a nonterminal. Regular modules may only contain full
      productions, whose syntax follows from&nbsp;</span><code>Full</code><span>&nbsp;in the&nbsp;</span><i>Rats!</i><span>&nbsp;syntax specification&nbsp;</span><a

       href="#syntax">above</a><span>.
      Module modifications may also contain alternative additions, alternative
      removals, and production overrides, which are discussed&nbsp;</span><a

       href="#modifications">below</a><span>.</span>
    <p>Each
      full production first lists zero or more attributes, then declares the
      type of the semantic value it returns, and then specifies the name of the
      nonterminal it defines (which must be unqualified). The definition follows
      after the equals sign&nbsp;<code>=</code>&nbsp;and is terminated by a
      semicolon&nbsp;<code>;</code>.
      Each full production can either be public, protected, or private, as
      indicated by the corresponding attribute of the same name. A public
      production is a top-level production for the grammar if it appears in the
      top-level module. Otherwise, it is treated as a protected production,
      which is the default, can be omitted, and makes the production
      referenceable from other modules. Finally, a private production can only
      be referenced from within the same module. Note that the use of the&nbsp;<code>transient</code>&nbsp;attribute is explained<a  href="#transient">here</a>.
      All per-production attributes supported by&nbsp;<i>Rats!</i>&nbsp;are discussed&nbsp;<a

         href="#attributes">here</a>.
      Further note that types cannot be primitive types, such as&nbsp;<code>int</code>;
      though, as discussed&nbsp;<a  href="#void">here</a>,&nbsp;<code>void</code>&nbsp;is
      allowed.</p>
    <p>A
      production's semantic value is usually defined in an action by setting the&nbsp;<code>yyValue</code>&nbsp;variable
      (so named in deference to the&nbsp;<a

         href="http://dinosaur.compilertools.net/">Yacc</a>&nbsp;parser
      generator) to the desired value. The action code can use characters or
      strings matched by a literal as well as semantic values returned by nested
      nonterminals through&nbsp;<i>bindings</i>.
      As specified&nbsp;<a  href="#syntax">above</a>,
      each binding first declares the variable, followed by a colon, and then
      the bound expression.</p>
    <p><a

         name="production-example"></a>For example, this is the production for
      the&nbsp;<code>FullProduction</code>&nbsp;nonterminal from&nbsp;<i>Rats!</i>'
      own grammar:</p>
    <pre>FullProduction FullProduction =
   atts:ProductionAttributes
   type:Name nt:UnqualifiedNonTerminal "=":Symbol choice:Choice ";":Symbol
      { yyValue = new FullProduction(atts.list(), type, nt, choice); }
   ;
</pre>
    <p>The
      production first declares the type of the semantic value it returns to be&nbsp;<code>FullProduction</code>&nbsp;(which only coincidentally
      has the same name as the production). In the definition, the semantic
      value of recognizing the production's attributes is bound to the variable&nbsp;<code>atts</code>, the
      semantic value returned by the&nbsp;<code>Name</code>&nbsp;production is bound to the
      variable&nbsp;<code>type</code>,
      the semantic value returned by the<code>UnqualifiedNonTerminal</code>&nbsp;production is bound to the
      variable&nbsp;<code>nt</code>,
      and the semantic value returned by the&nbsp;<code>Choice</code>&nbsp;production is bound to the
      variable&nbsp;<code>choice</code>.
      The action code then uses these variables to create a new&nbsp;<code>FullProduction</code>&nbsp;object and assigns that
      object to&nbsp;<code>yyValue</code>,
      thus making the newly created object the production's semantic value.</p>
    <p>In
      the generated parser,&nbsp;<i>Rats!</i>&nbsp;declares the types of
      variables as following:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Variables bound to the any character constant&nbsp;<code>_</code>,
        to a character literal, or a character class are declared as&nbsp;<code>char</code>.</li>
      <li>Variables bound to a string literal are declared as&nbsp;<code>String</code>.</li>
      <li>Variables bound to a nonterminal are declared to be of the type of the
        corresponding production. For example, the declared type of the&nbsp;<code>Name</code>&nbsp;production from the above
        example is&nbsp;<code>String</code>&nbsp;and, consequently,&nbsp;<code>type</code>&nbsp;is declared to be a&nbsp;<code>String</code>&nbsp;as well.</li>
      <li>Similarly,&nbsp;<code>yyValue</code>&nbsp;is declared to be of the
        type of the corresponding production.</li>
    </ul>
    <a  name="pass-through"></a>
    <h4>Passing
      the Semantic Value Through</h4>
    <span>Sometimes,
      the semantic value of a production is the same as the semantic value of
      one of the expressions appearing in that production. To avoid first
      binding that expression to some variable and then assigning that variable
      to&nbsp;</span><code>yyValue</code><span>&nbsp;, it is possible to directly
      bind&nbsp;</span><code>yyValue</code><span>.</span>
    <p>For
      example, the production for the&nbsp;<code>Header</code>&nbsp;nonterminal from&nbsp;<i>Rats!</i>'
      own grammar makes use of this feature:</p>
    <pre>Action Header = "header":Word yyValue:Action ;
</pre><span>An
      equivalent, but more verbose definition might look like this:</span>
    <pre>Action Header = "header":Word a:Action { yyValue = a; } ;
</pre><a  name="options-etc"></a>
    <h4>Options,
      Repetitions, and Nested Choices</h4>
    <span>In
      general,&nbsp;</span><i>Rats!</i><span>&nbsp;lifts options, repetitions,
      and nested choices into their own, newly generated productions. It also
      desugars options and repetitions into equivalent productions without the
      option or repetition operators. Note that nested choices are&nbsp;</span><i>not</i><span>&nbsp;lifted if they are the last
      element in a sequence. Further note that repetitions are&nbsp;</span><i>not</i><span>&nbsp;desugared if they appear in
      a&nbsp;</span><a  href="#transient">transient</a><span>&nbsp;production. Finally, options
      are&nbsp;</span><i>not</i><span>&nbsp;desugared if they are not
      bound or if&nbsp;</span><i>Rats</i><span>&nbsp;can automatically deduce the
      value of the bound optional expression.</span>
    <p>This
      lifting and desugaring raises several questions:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>What is the semantic value of an expression before applying the option
        or repetition operator? Similarly, what is the semantic value of a
        nested choice?</li>
      <li>For options and repetitions, what is the semantic value after applying
        the option or repetition operator?</li>
      <li>Finally, for each of these expressions, what is the type of the newly
        generated production?</li>
    </ul>
    <span>We
      now answer these questions in turn.</span>
    <p>To
      determine the semantic value of an expression before applying the option
      or repetition operator and that of a nested choice,&nbsp;<i>Rats!</i>&nbsp;generally requires that each
      expression has its own, embedded action that defines the corresponding
      value. As a result, the definition of a production may contain several
      actions that all assign values to&nbsp;<code>yyValue</code>,
      even in nested expressions.</p>
    <p>However,
      for some expressions,&nbsp;<i>Rats!</i>&nbsp;is able to automatically
      deduce their semantic values. Notably, if a nonterminal is optional or
      repeated, the semantic value of the expression before applying the option
      or repetition operator simply is the semantic value of the nonterminal's
      production. Similarly, if a nonterminal is the only expression appearing
      in an option, the semantic value for that option simply is the semantic
      value of the nonterminal's production. In these cases, no embedded actions
      are necessary.</p>
    <p>For
      options, the semantic value after applying the option operator is the
      semantic value of the expression, if that expression can be matched in the
      input. Otherwise, the overall semantic value is simply<code>null</code>.
      For repetitions, the semantic value after applying the repetition operator
      is a {@link xtc.util.Pair}. Pairs are used to implement singly-linked
      lists and contain the semantic values of the repeated expressions. In the
      case of zero matches, the pair is the special {@link xtc.util.Pair#EMPTY
      empty pair}, which is also accessible through the type-safe {@link
      xtc.util.Pair#empty()} method.&nbsp;<i>Rats!</i>&nbsp;uses pairs as they allow for
      efficient addition of an element to the front of a sequence of pairs. Note
      that pairs can easily be converted into a Java Collections Framework list
      by calling {@link xtc.util.Pair#list()} (as illustrated in the production
      for&nbsp;<i>Rats!</i>&nbsp;productions
      shown&nbsp;<a  href="#production-example">above</a>).</p>
    <p>The
      type of a newly generated production representing a desugared option
      generally is&nbsp;<code>Object</code>.
      However, if&nbsp;<i>Rats!</i>&nbsp;can automatically determine
      the semantic value of an optional expression, it uses the more specific
      type (which, in the case of desugared optional nonterminals, is the type
      of the corresponding production). The type of a newly generated production
      representing a desugared repetition always is&nbsp;<code>xtc.util.Pair</code>.
      Finally, the type of a newly generated production representing a lifted
      choice always is&nbsp;<code>Object</code>.</p>
    <p>To
      illustrate the general case of repetitions and nested choices, consider
      the following snippet from&nbsp;<i>Rats!</i>'
      own grammar, which is taken from the&nbsp;<code>Terminal</code>&nbsp;production and parses
      character class specifications:</p>
    <pre>   / '['
      l:( c1:ClassChar '-' c2:ClassChar
         { 
            yyValue = new CharRange(Utilities.unescape(c1).charAt(0),
                                    Utilities.unescape(c2).charAt(0));
         }
        / c1:ClassChar
         {
            yyValue = new CharRange(Utilities.unescape(c1).charAt(0));
         }
        )*
     ']' Spacing
      { yyValue = new CharClass(l.list()); }
</pre><span>The
      nested choice has its own actions, which create character ranges as their
      semantic values. The parser collects these character ranges into a
      sequence of pairs, which is then bound to the&nbsp;</span><code>l</code><span>&nbsp;variable. The outer action
      uses this sequence of pairs to create a new character class as the overall
      semantic value (converting the sequence of pairs into a Java Collections
      Framework list along the way).</span>
    <p><a

         name="sequence-example"></a>To illustrate the automatic deduction of a
      semantic value, consider the production for sequences from&nbsp;<i>Rats!</i>'
      own grammar:</p>
    <pre>Sequence Sequence =
   !Ellipsis n:SequenceName? l:Voided*
      { yyValue = new Sequence(n, l.list()); }
   ;
</pre><span>A
      sequence essentially consists of zero or more repetitions of the&nbsp;</span><code>Voided</code><span>&nbsp;nonterminal; no embedded
      action is necessary for the repetition.&nbsp;</span><i>Rats!</i><span>&nbsp;automatically collects the
      individual semantic values into a sequence of pairs. The optional sequence
      name preceding the repeated&nbsp;</span><code>Voided</code><span>&nbsp;nonterminal simply is an
      identifier between less-than&nbsp;</span><code>&lt;</code><span>&nbsp;and greater-than&nbsp;</span><code>&gt;</code><span>&nbsp;signs and is used when&nbsp;</span><a  href="#modifications">modifying
      productions</a><span>.
      It can also be used for documentation, as&nbsp;</span><i>Rats!</i><span>&nbsp;tries to preserve it
      throughout its internal processing, so that it will be included in the
      generated parser (within a comment). The corresponding optional expression
      does not need an embedded action either. The syntactic predicate&nbsp;</span><code>!Ellipsis</code><span>&nbsp;excludes sequence names
      followed by an ellipsis&nbsp;</span><code>...</code><span>&nbsp;or an ellipsis by itself
      from sequences, as they are used to&nbsp;</span><a

       name="void"></a>
    <h4>Void
      and Text-Only Productions</h4>
    <span>Adding
      actions to create a production's semantic value can seem tedious and may
      make grammars unnecessarily verbose. To reduce the need for explicit
      actions,&nbsp;</span><i>Rats!</i><span>&nbsp;supports special types of
      productions, which need&nbsp;</span><i>no</i><span>&nbsp;semantic actions at all. We
      now discuss void and text-only productions, which are especially useful
      for recognizing lexical syntax (such as identifiers, punctuation, numbers,
      and so on).</span>
    <p>A&nbsp;<i>void production</i>&nbsp;is a production that
      declares the type of its semantic value to be&nbsp;<code>void</code>.
      Such a production does not require any actions, but it may not be bound to
      an identifier either. A void production is typically used for ignored
      spacing or punctuation elements. Void productions also improve the
      accuracy of&nbsp;<i>Rats!</i>'
      deduction of a compound expression's semantic value. If the compound
      expression only contains a single non-void nonterminal, that nonterminal's
      semantic value is used as the semantic value of the entire expression.</p>
    <p>Here
      is an example void production from&nbsp;<i>Rats!</i>'
      own grammar:</p>
    <pre>transient void Spacing =
  (Space / LineTerminator / TraditionalComment/ EndOfLineComment)*
  ;
</pre><span>This
      production matches space characters, line terminators, and comments. Note
      that the&nbsp;</span><code>transient</code><span>&nbsp;keyword is explained&nbsp;</span><a

       href="#transient">here</a><span>.</span>
    <p>The
      fact the&nbsp;<code>Spacing</code>&nbsp;is declared as&nbsp;<code>void</code>&nbsp;is then used in the
      production for&nbsp;<code>Symbol</code>:</p>
    <pre>String Symbol = SymbolCharacters Spacing ;
</pre><span>No
      action is necessary because only the&nbsp;</span><code>SymbolCharacters</code><span>&nbsp;nonterminal produces a
      semantic value.&nbsp;</span><i>Rats!</i><span>&nbsp;automatically detects this
      case and passes the value of&nbsp;</span><code>SymbolCharacters</code><span>&nbsp;through.</span>
    <p>In
      general,&nbsp;<i>Rats!</i>&nbsp;tries to deduce a compound
      expression's value, even if it is nested within another expression,
      ignoring nonterminals referencing a void production or explicitly voided
      expressions. Furthermore, for repetitions, options, and nested choices
      that do not appear as the last expression in a sequence, it treats the&nbsp;<em>entire</em>&nbsp;repetition,
      option, or nested choice as void, if all component expressions are
      nonterminals referencing void productions, explicitly voided expressions,
      or predicates. For example, if&nbsp;<code>nt</code>&nbsp;references a void
      production, then the expression "<code>nt*</code>" is equivalent to "<code>void:(nt*)</code>"
      (note that the parentheses are not strictly necessary).</p>
    <p>A&nbsp;<i>text-only production</i>&nbsp;is a production that
      declares the type of its semantic value to be a&nbsp;<code>String</code>,
      does not contain any bindings to&nbsp;<code>yyValue</code>&nbsp;nor actions that reference&nbsp;<code>yyValue</code>&nbsp;and
      references only other text-only productions (if any). The semantic value
      of a text-only production is the text matched in the input, represented as
      a&nbsp;<code>String</code>.
      Note that the above&nbsp;<code>Symbol</code>&nbsp;production is not text-only
      because it references a void production. Also note that bindings (besides
      to&nbsp;<code>yyValue</code>)
      and semantic predicates may appear in text-only productions.</p>
    <p><a

         name="transient-example"></a>To illustrate text-only productions,
      consider the following productions from&nbsp;<i>Rats!</i>'
      own grammar:</p>
    <pre>String StringLiteral            = ["] ( EscapeSequence / !["\\] _ )* ["] ;

transient String EscapeSequence = 
   '\\' ( [btnfr\"\'\-\[\\\]] / 'u' HexNumber ) ;
transient String HexNumber      = HexDigit HexDigit HexDigit HexDigit ;
transient String HexDigit       = [0-9a-fA-F] ;
</pre><span>The&nbsp;</span><code>StringLiteral</code><span>&nbsp;production only references
      terminals and other productions that are also text-only. As a result, its
      semantic value is the text matched in the input, exactly what we expect
      from a production that matches string literals. Note that the&nbsp;</span><code>transient</code><span>&nbsp;keyword is explained&nbsp;</span><a

       href="#transient">here</a><span>.</span>
    <p>A
      note on bindings&nbsp;<i>within</i>&nbsp;text-only productions: When
      binding to a character terminal (the any character constant, a character
      class, or a character literal), the bound variable is a&nbsp;<code>char</code>&nbsp;(just as for all other
      productions). However, for&nbsp;<i>all</i>&nbsp;other expressions (including
      options, repetitions, and nested choices), the value of the bound variable
      always is a string representing the text matched by that expression in the
      input. For options that cannot be matched in the input, the value is the
      empty string (and not&nbsp;<code>null</code>).<a

         name="generic"></a></p>
    <h4>Generic
      Productions</h4>
    <span>Void
      and text-only productions typically help with recognizing lexical syntax;
      though, they are of limited use for productions that recognize
      hierarchical syntax, such as the productions for</span><code>FullProduction</code><span>,&nbsp;</span><code>Header</code><span>,
      or&nbsp;</span><code>Sequence</code><span>&nbsp;shown above. Generic
      productions help simplify productions for hierarchical syntax. Just as for
      void and text-only productions, no explicit semantic actions are required.</span>
    <p>A&nbsp;<i>generic production</i>&nbsp;is a production that
      declares&nbsp;<code>generic</code>&nbsp;as its type and returns a
      semantic value that is a {@link xtc.tree.GNode generic node}.&nbsp;<i>Rats!</i>&nbsp;automatically creates the
      production's semantic value: its name is the name of the production, and
      its children are the semantic values of the component expressions in the
      recognized sequence, with the exception of any voided expressions (using
      the<code>void:</code>&nbsp;operator),
      void nonterminals, and character terminals, which are ignored.</p>
    <p>For
      example, we could rewrite the production for&nbsp;<a

         href="#production-example"><code>FullProduction</code></a>&nbsp;as a generic production:</p>
    <pre>generic FullProduction =
   ProductionAttributes
   Name UnqualifiedNonTerminal void:"=":Symbol Choice void:";":Symbol ;
   ;
</pre><span>The
      rewritten production has a generic node as its semantic value; the grammar
      author thus does not need to define a&nbsp;</span><code>FullProduction</code><span>&nbsp;class to represent the
      semantic value. Furthermore, the rewritten production is equivalent to the
      following production with an explicit semantic action:</span>
    <pre>Node FullProduction =
   v1:ProductionAttributes
   v2:Name v3:UnqualifiedNonTerminal "=":Symbol v4:Choice ";":Symbol
     { yyValue = GNode.create("Production", v1, v2, v3, v4); }
   ;
</pre><span>The
      two symbol references are not bound because they are explicitly voided.</span>
    <p>Options,
      repetitions, and nested choices in generic productions are treated just
      like the corresponding expressions in regular productions. In other words,
      they may be desugared and lifted into their own productions. As a result,
      they require explicit actions to create their semantic values, unless, of
      course,&nbsp;<i>Rats!</i>&nbsp;can automatically determine
      the corresponding values.</p>
    <p>The
      creation of generic syntax tree nodes can be customized through the&nbsp;<a

         href="#attributes">factory
        attribute</a>, which specifies a class different from&nbsp;<code>GNode</code>.
      For example,&nbsp;<code>factory(MyTreeFactory)</code>&nbsp;causes&nbsp;<em>Rats!</em>&nbsp;to emit invocations to&nbsp;<code>MyTreeFactory.create</code>&nbsp;methods instead of&nbsp;<code>GNode.create</code>.<a

         name="list-valued"></a></p>
    <h4>List-Valued
      Productions</h4>
    <p>If
      a grammar has the&nbsp;<code>flatten</code>&nbsp;attribute, pairs resulting
      from a repeated expression are treated somewhat differently in generic
      productions: the values on the list are added to the production's generic
      node as&nbsp;<i>individual</i>&nbsp;children. For example,
      consider this production for recognizing parameter lists in C:</p>
    <pre>generic ParameterList =
   ParameterDeclaration (void:",":Symbol ParameterDeclaration)* ;
</pre><span>Because
      the semantic values of the embedded repetition are added as invidividual
      children to the production's generic node, that node's children are all
      parameter declarations, which is exactly the desired behavior.</span>
    <p>Alternatively,&nbsp;<i>Rats!</i>&nbsp;can
      automatically deduce the semantic value of productions with a&nbsp;<code>Pair</code>&nbsp;type. The production's value
      is a list of all of a sequence's component expressions. For example,
      consider this rewritten production for recognizing parameter lists:</p>
    <pre>Pair&lt;Node&gt; ParameterList =
   ParameterDeclaration (void:",":Symbol ParameterDeclaration)* ;
</pre><span>Beacuse
      the declared type is&nbsp;</span><code>Pair&lt;Node&gt;</code><span>,&nbsp;</span><i>Rats!</i><span>&nbsp;automatically deduces the
      semantic value of the production. It is a list containing the value of the
      first parameter declaration followed by the value of the repetition. The
      production is equivalent to the following production using an explicit
      semantic action:</span>
    <pre>Pair&lt;Node&gt; ParameterList =
   head:ParamterDeclaration tail:(void:",":Symbol ParameterDeclaration)*
   { yyValue = new Pair&lt;Node&gt;(head, tail); } ;
</pre><span>As
      illustrated by this version,&nbsp;</span><i>Rats!</i><span>&nbsp;recognizes when the last
      component expression in a list-valued production already has a list value
      and turns that value into the overall list's tail. If the last component
      expression does not have a list value, the overall list's tail is the
      empty list.</span>
    <p>Whether
      to (1) use the&nbsp;<code>flatten</code>&nbsp;attribute so that list
      elements are added as individual children to generic nodes or (2) use
      list-valued productions to create lists and preserve them as generic
      nodes' children is a trade-off. With the&nbsp;<code>flatten</code>&nbsp;attribute, ASTs are more
      uniform, typically consisting of only generic nodes and strings. In
      contrast, without the&nbsp;<code>flatten</code>&nbsp;attribute, generic nodes may
      also contain lists of, say, nodes or strings. However, flattening lists
      may result in the loss of information. For example, consider this
      production for Java compilation units:</p>
    <pre>public generic CompilationUnit =
  Spacing
  PackageDeclaration? ImportDeclaration* Declaration*
  EndOfFile ;
</pre><span>When
      lists are flattened, there is no way to distinguish import declarations
      from regular declarations&nbsp;</span><em>without</em><span>&nbsp;looking at the actual
      children. In contrast, when lists are not flattened, the generic node for
      compilation units has exactly three children, corresponding to package,
      import, and regular declarations respectively. Additionally, the
      preservation of lists in generic nodes enables more exact typing of ASTs
      through&nbsp;</span><i>Rats!</i><span>'&nbsp;</span><code>-ast</code><span>&nbsp;option. Consequently, the
      recommended practice is&nbsp;</span><em>not</em><span>&nbsp;to use the&nbsp;</span><code>flatten</code><span>&nbsp;attribute.</span><span></span><a

       name="left-recursion"></a>
    <h4>Left-Recursive
      Productions</h4>
    <p>To
      simplify the specification of productions that recognize expressions at
      different precedence levels, void, text-only, and generic productions may
      contain&nbsp;<i>direct</i>&nbsp;left-recursions; though
      arbitrary left-recursions are illegal in&nbsp;<i>Rats!</i>&nbsp;grammars just as for PEGs.
      Directly left-recursive productions are automatically transformed into
      equivalent right-iterative productions, while preserving the
      left-recursive structure of the original production's semantic value. As
      an example, consider the following generic production for recognizing
      logical and expressions in C:</p>
    <pre>generic LogicalAndExpression =
     LogicalAndExpression void:"&amp;&amp;":Symbol BitwiseOrExpression
   / BitwiseOrExpression
   ;
</pre><span>This
      directly left-recursive production is equivalent to the following two
      productions, which leverage so-called actions (i.e., promises) to create
      the semantic values:</span>
    <pre>Node LogicalAndExpression =
   seed:BitwiseOrExpression actions:LogicalAndExpressionTail*
      { yyValue = apply(actions, seed); }
   ;

constant Action&lt;Node&gt; LogicalAndExpressionTail =
   "&amp;&amp;":Symbol right:BitwiseOrExpression
      {
         yyValue = new Action&lt;Node&gt;() {
            public Node run(Node left) {
               Node result = GNode.create("LogicalAndExpression", left, right);
               result.setLocation(location(yyStart));
               return result;
            }};
      }
   ;
</pre><span>The&nbsp;</span><code>LogicalAndExpressionTail*</code><span>&nbsp;expression creates a list of
      {@link xtc.util.Action actions}, with each action on the list creating a
      generic node that is annotated with the source location corresponding to
      the start of the production. (The&nbsp;</span><code>constant</code><span>&nbsp;attribute ensures that the
      Java binding for&nbsp;</span><code>right</code><span>&nbsp;is declared&nbsp;</span><code>final</code><span>;
      this is necessary because&nbsp;</span><code>right</code><span>&nbsp;is referenced in an
      anonymous inner class.) The</span><code>LogicalAndExpression</code><span>&nbsp;production uses {@link
      xtc.parser.ParserBase#apply(Pair,Object)} to apply each action in the list
      onto the result of the previous action, starting with the&nbsp;</span><code>seed</code><span>&nbsp;value for the first action.
      If the list is empty, the seed value is simply passed through, which is
      the desired behavior. By using actions and thus delaying the creation of
      generic nodes, the rewritten productions ensure that the resulting
      abstract syntax tree preserves left-associativity. Note that actions can
      also be used outside of generic productions to create left-associative
      abstract syntax trees.</span>
    <p>In
      the previous example, the use of a list of actions results in the correct
      treatment of the base case: no new generic node is created, rather the
      semantic value of the bitwise or expression is simply passed through. When
      specifying productions that do not use actions, grammar writers can
      achieve similar results by explicitly binding&nbsp;<code>yyValue</code>.
      For alternatives in a generic production that assign<code>yyValue</code>&nbsp;either through a binding or
      a semantic action,&nbsp;<i>Rats!</i>&nbsp;does not create a new
      generic node but rather uses the explicitly specified semantic value.<a  name="node-markers"></a></p>
    <h4>Node
      Markers in Generic Productions</h4>
    <p>Also
      in the previous example, there is only one recursive alternative;
      consequently, the production's name, i.e., "<code>LogicalAndExpression</code>",
      provides a meaningful name for the newly created generic node. However,
      languages such as C contain more than one left-recursive operator at the
      same precedence level. Using the features described so far, grammar
      developers can either write one directly left-recursive generic production
      for all operators, thus using the same name for all operators' generic
      nodes, or they can write several right-iterative productions that create
      the generic nodes through explicit semantic actions. Neither option is
      particularly attractive and node markers provide a more elegant solution.
      They are written as an at sign '<code>@</code>' immediately followed by an
      identifier and specify a generic node's name for nodes generated by the
      sequence they appear in.</p>
    <p>As
      an example, consider the following generic production for recognizing
      postfix expressions in C:</p>
    <pre>generic PostfixExpression =
    &lt;Subscript&gt;         PostfixExpression void:"[":Symbol Expression
                                          void:"]":Symbol
                                          @SubscriptExpression
  / &lt;DirectSelection&gt;   PostfixExpression void:".":Symbol Identifier
                                          @DirectComponentSelection
  / &lt;IndirectSelection&gt; PostfixExpression void:"-&gt;":Symbol Identifier
                                          @IndirectComponentSelection
  / &lt;FunctionCall&gt;      PostfixExpression void:"(":Symbol ExpressionList?
                                          void:")":Symbol
                                          @FunctionCall
  / &lt;Increment&gt;         PostfixExpression void:"++":Symbol
                                          @PostincrementExpression
  / &lt;Decrement&gt;         PostfixExpression void:"--":Symbol
                                          @PostdecrementExpression
  / &lt;Compound&gt;          CompoundLiteral
  / &lt;Primary&gt;           PrimaryExpression
  ;
</pre><span>In
      a single directly left-recursive production, the example specifies all of
      C's postfix expressions. Yet, each recursive alternative contains a
      distinct node marker, thus resulting in a differently named generic node.
      Internally (and as described above),&nbsp;</span><i>Rats!</i><span>&nbsp;converts the directly
      left-recursive production into the corresponding right-iterative version,
      which uses actions to create left-recursive AST nodes. Note that the last
      two alternatives do not require node markers (nor bindings to&nbsp;</span><code>yyValue</code><span>)
      because they provide the base cases for the recursion.</span><span></span><a

       name="parameters"></a>
    <h4>Modules,
      Name Spaces, and Parameters</h4>
    <span>The
      intent behind&nbsp;</span><i>Rats!</i><span>'
      module system is to facilitate the re-use and extensibility of grammar
      specifications. Even without parameters and modifications, basic modules
      help, as they allow a grammar writer to break up a grammar into several
      units. All modules exist in the same global name space. Without parameters
      and modifications, this name space consists simply of the module names as
      specified by the corresponding&nbsp;</span><code>module</code><span>&nbsp;declarations. With
      parameters and modifications, this name space consists of the module names
      of all&nbsp;</span><em>instantiated</em><span>&nbsp;modules (with instantiation
      being the process of providing arguments to parameterized modules).</span>
    <p>In
      contrast to module names, nonterminals are only meaningful in relation to
      a specific module. Without any&nbsp;<code>import</code>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<code>modify</code>&nbsp;declarations, a module can
      only reference the nonterminals defined in that module. In the presence of&nbsp;<code>import</code>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<code>modify</code>&nbsp;declarations,
      a module can also reference the public and protected nonterminals defined
      by imported modules and all nonterminals defined by modified modules.</p>
    <p>Nonterminals
      may be ambiguous, e.g., the same nonterminal may be defined within a
      module and an imported module or in several imported modules.&nbsp;<i>Rats!</i>&nbsp;gives precedence to
      nonterminals defined in the same module as the nonterminal reference. For
      example, if module&nbsp;<code>Foo</code>&nbsp;defines nonterminal&nbsp;<code>Name</code>&nbsp;and imports module&nbsp;<code>Bar</code>,
      which also defines nonterminal&nbsp;<code>Name</code>,
      then a reference to&nbsp;<code>Name</code>&nbsp;appearing in one of&nbsp;<code>Foo</code>'s
      productions is interpreted to mean&nbsp;<code>Foo</code>'s&nbsp;<code>Name</code>.&nbsp;<code>Bar</code>'s&nbsp;<code>Name</code>&nbsp;can
      still be referenced by using the qualified notation&nbsp;<code>Bar.Name</code>.
      Furthermore, if module&nbsp;<code>Foo</code>&nbsp;does not define&nbsp;<code>Name</code>&nbsp;but imports&nbsp;<code>Bar</code>and&nbsp;<code>Baz</code>, which both
      define&nbsp;<code>Name</code>,
      any reference to&nbsp;<code>Name</code>&nbsp;in&nbsp;<code>Foo</code>&nbsp;must be qualified, writing&nbsp;<code>Bar.Name</code>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<code>Baz.Name</code>&nbsp;respectively.
      Note that, while qualified nonterminals are globally unique and thus
      always unambiguous, a nonterminal, whether qualified or not, can only be
      used if the corresponding production's module is the same module, imported
      by the referencing module, or modified by the referencing module.</p>
    <p>Parameterized
      modules improve re-use when compared to basic modules, as the same
      parameterized module can be used with different actual dependencies. For
      example, module&nbsp;<code>xtc.util.Symbol</code>takes
      one parameter for a module defining spacing:</p>
    <pre>module xtc.util.Symbol(Spacing);

import Spacing;

String Symbol = SymbolCharacters Spacing ;

transient String SymbolCharacters = <i>..elided..</i> ;
</pre><span>As
      a result, this module can be instantiated with different forms of spacing,
      without changing&nbsp;</span><code>xtc.util.Symbol</code><span>.
      At the same time, an instantiation must provide a module that specifies a
      void nonterminal</span><code>Spacing</code><span>&nbsp;for the resulting module to
      be meaningful.</span>
    <p>A
      parameterized module is instantiated by specifying the corresponding
      arguments in the corresponding&nbsp;<code>import</code>&nbsp;declaration:</p>
    <pre>import xtc.util.Symbol(xtc.util.Spacing);
</pre><span>This&nbsp;</span><code>import</code><span>&nbsp;declaration without a target
      name is equivalent to the following declaration with a target name:</span>
    <pre>import xtc.util.Symbol(xtc.util.Spacing) as xtc.util.Symbol;
</pre><span>In
      either case, all occurrences of the parameter module name&nbsp;</span><code>Spacing</code><span>&nbsp;are replaced by the
      specified argument module name&nbsp;</span><code>xtc.util.Spacing</code><span>.
      Furthermore, all occurrences of the module name itself are replaced by the
      specified target name (which, in this example, is the same as the module
      name). Finally, the instantiated module becomes the sole module of that
      name in the global module name space. No other instantiation with the same
      target name is possible, unless it instantiates exactly the same module
      with the same arguments.</span>
    <p>Note
      that the nonterminal&nbsp;<code>Spacing</code>&nbsp;in the production for&nbsp;<code>Symbol</code>&nbsp;is not renamed during
      instantiation, as it denotes a nonterminal and not a module. However, if
      the nonterminal was written as<code>Spacing.Spacing</code>, it would be
      renamed to&nbsp;<code>xtc.util.Spacing.Spacing</code>.
      Further note that&nbsp;<code>xtc.util.Symbol</code>&nbsp;could be instantiated with a
      different argument within the same grammar, as long as that
      instantiation's target name is different. Finally, note that once
      instantiated, other modules can reference the instantiated module through
      its target name. For example, after module&nbsp;<code>xtc.util.Symbol</code>&nbsp;has been instantiated
      through either of the above&nbsp;<code>import</code>&nbsp;declarations, it can also be
      imported as following:</p>
    <pre>import xtc.util.Symbol;
</pre><span>This
      import declaration, when appearing in a dependent module, references the
      same instantiated module.</span>
    <p>While
      module parameters and arguments can only be module names and never more
      complex expressions, sometimes more complex arguments are desirable. For
      example, a grammar writer may want to instantiate&nbsp;<code>xtc.util.Symbol</code>&nbsp;with a more complex module&nbsp;<code>my.Spacing</code>,
      which requires its own argument&nbsp;<code>my.Argument</code>.
      In this case, the grammar writer can use an&nbsp;<code>instantiate</code>&nbsp;declaration, which
      instantiates a module but does not make its nonterminals accessible from
      within the instantiating module. In the example, the grammar writer would
      use the following declarations:</p>
    <pre>instantiate my.Spacing(my.Argument) as Spacing;
import xtc.util.Symbol(Spacing);
</pre>
    <p>Module
      dependencies are resolved through a breadth-first search starting with the
      top-level module. In other words, a dependent module's dependencies are
      only processed&nbsp;<em>after</em>&nbsp;all the dependencies of the
      depending module have been resolved. As a result, the order of&nbsp;<code>import</code>,&nbsp;<code>instantiate</code>,
      and&nbsp;<code>modify</code>&nbsp;declarations in a module
      does not matter and mutually dependent modules can be instantiated within
      the same module. For example,&nbsp;<code>xtc.lang.CSpacing</code>&nbsp;has a parameter for a
      constant module and&nbsp;<code>xtc.lang.CConstant</code>&nbsp;has a parameter for a
      spacing module, with each module importing the parameterized module. To
      instantiate these two mutually dependent modules, module&nbsp;<code>xtc.lang.C</code>&nbsp;simply declares (with some
      intermediate declarations omitted and ignoring the additional<code>xtc.lang.CState</code>&nbsp;argument):</p>
    <pre>instantiate xtc.lang.CConstant(xtc.lang.CSpacing);
instantiate xtc.lang.CSpacing(xtc.lang.CState, xtc.lang.CConstant);
</pre><span>Because
      it uses breadth-first search,&nbsp;</span><i>Rats!</i><span>&nbsp;processes these two&nbsp;</span><code>instantiate</code><span>&nbsp;declarations before
      processing the corresponding&nbsp;</span><code>import</code><span>&nbsp;declarations in&nbsp;</span><code>xtc.lang.CConstant</code><span>&nbsp;and&nbsp;</span><code>xtc.lang.CSpacing</code><span>.
      By the time&nbsp;</span><i>Rats</i><span>&nbsp;reaches the&nbsp;</span><code>import</code><span>&nbsp;declarations in the
      dependent modules, the modules have been instantiated and no arguments are
      necessary.</span><span></span><a

       name="modifications"></a>
    <h4>Module
      Modifications</h4>
    <span>To
      further facilitate re-use and extensibility,&nbsp;</span><i>Rats!</i><span>&nbsp;supports module
      modifications, which concisely express extensions to a grammar and, in
      addition to full productions, can also contain&nbsp;</span><em>alternative
      additions</em><span>,
      which add new alternatives to a production's top-level choice,&nbsp;</span><em>alternative
      removals</em><span>,
      which remove alternatives from a production's top-level choice, and&nbsp;</span><em>production
      overrides</em><span>,
      which can override an entire production, specific alternatives, or a
      production's attributes. All three types of partial production, whose
      syntax is specified&nbsp;</span><a

       href="#syntax">above</a><span>&nbsp;and illustrated below,
      depend on the different alternatives in a production's top-level choice
      having sequence names. Consequently, it is good practice to always name
      your sequences!</span>
    <p>A
      module modification must contain a single&nbsp;<code>modify</code>&nbsp;declaration, which specifies
      the module to be modified. For example, the following declaration
      specifies that module&nbsp;<code>xtc.lang.JavaSymbol</code>&nbsp;modifies module&nbsp;<code>Symbol</code>:</p>
    <pre>module xtc.lang.JavaSymbol(Symbol);

modify Symbol;
</pre><span>The
      example uses a module parameter to ensure that module&nbsp;</span><code>xtc.lang.JavaSymbol</code><span>&nbsp;can be applied to different
      versions of&nbsp;</span><code>Symbol</code><span>.
      The resulting module contains all full productions appearing in both the
      modifying and modified modules (in the example,&nbsp;</span><code>xtc.lang.JavaSymbol</code><span>&nbsp;and&nbsp;</span><code>Symbol</code><span>,
      respectively). Furthermore, all productions in the resulting module are
      modified as specified by the alternative additions, alternative removals,
      and production overrides in the modifying module. Modifications are
      applied in the same order as they appear in the modifying module (in the
      example,</span><code>xtc.lang.JavaSymbol</code><span>).
      The resulting productions are the only versions; i.e., all nonterminals,
      whether they originally appear in the modifying module or the modified
      module reference the modified productions.</span>
    <p>The
      resulting module's options are the options of the modifying module, with
      exception of any&nbsp;<a  href="#stateful"><code>stateful</code></a>,&nbsp;<a  href="#set"><code>setOfString</code></a>,
      and&nbsp;<a  href="#flag"><code>flag</code></a>&nbsp;options, which are preserved
      if they appear in the modified module's options. Furthermore, the
      modifying module's header, body, and footer actions are combined with the
      modified module's actions (if they exist).</p>
    <p>An
      alternative addition adds an expression before or after an existing
      sequence. For example, the following addition adds sequence&nbsp;<code><i>s</i></code>&nbsp;after sequence&nbsp;<code>&lt;Bar&gt;</code>&nbsp;in production&nbsp;<code>Foo</code>:</p>
    <pre>Type Foo += &lt;Bar&gt; ... / &lt;NewSequence&gt; <i>s</i> ;
</pre><span>Similarly,
      the following addition adds the new sequence before sequence&nbsp;</span><code>&lt;Bar&gt;</code><span>:</span>
    <pre>Type Foo += &lt;NewSequence&gt; <i>s</i> / &lt;Bar&gt; ... ;
</pre><span>Note
      that the new expression may actually consist of several sequences and not
      only one as suggested by the examples. Further note that the type and
      nonterminal must both be specified and match an existing full production.</span>
    <p>An
      alternative removal removes one or more sequences from a production. For
      example, the following removal eliminates sequences&nbsp;<code>&lt;Bar&gt;</code>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<code>&lt;Baz&gt;</code>&nbsp;from production&nbsp;<code>Foo</code>:</p>
    <pre>Type Foo -= &lt;Bar&gt;, &lt;Baz&gt; ;
</pre><span>As
      before, the type and nonterminal must both be specified and match an
      existing full production.</span>
    <p>A
      production override can replace all alternatives, only specific
      alternatives, or a production's attributes. For example, the following
      override replaces all alternatives of production&nbsp;<code>Foo</code>&nbsp;with expression<code><i>e</i></code>:</p>
    <pre>Type Foo := <i>e</i> ;
</pre><span>In
      contrast, this override only replaces alternatives&nbsp;</span><code>&lt;Bar&gt;</code><span>&nbsp;and&nbsp;</span><code>&lt;Baz&lt;</code><span>:</span>
    <pre>Type Foo := ... / &lt;Bar&gt; <i>s1</i> / &lt;Baz&gt; <i>s2</i> ;
</pre><span>Finally,
      this override replaces&nbsp;</span><code>Foo</code><span>'s
      attributes with the&nbsp;</span><code>public</code><span>&nbsp;attribute:</span>
    <pre>public Type Foo := ... ;
</pre><span>Note
      that the list of attributes may be empty, thus removing all attributes
      from the full production.</span><span></span><a

       name="transient"></a>
    <h4>Memoization
      and Transient Productions</h4>
    <span>Packrat
      parsers process their input in time linear to the size of the input, even
      if they need to backtrack. The reason they can do this is that they store,
      or&nbsp;</span><i>memoize</i><span>,
      the result of trying each nonterminal at every input position – hence the
      name "packrat" parser.</span>
    <p>The
      benefits of memoization are best illustrated with a production from&nbsp;<i>Rats!</i>'
      own grammar:</p>
    <pre>Element Suffix =
   ( p:Primary "?":Symbol { yyValue = new Option(p);            }
   / p:Primary "*":Symbol { yyValue = new Repetition(false, p); }
   / p:Primary "+":Symbol { yyValue = new Repetition(true,  p); }
   / Primary
   )
   ;
</pre><span>The&nbsp;</span><code>Suffix</code><span>&nbsp;production matches possible
      suffix expressions in the input, with each of the four alternatives in the
      choice first trying to parse a primary expression. Assume that the current
      input contains a primary expression&nbsp;</span><i>without</i><span>&nbsp;a suffix (i.e., the fourth
      alternative is the alternative that will succeed). If the parser did&nbsp;</span><i>not</i><span>&nbsp;memoize its results, the
      primary expression would be parsed&nbsp;</span><i>four</i><span>&nbsp;times, once for each
      alternative, resulting in suboptimal performance. However, because parsers
      generated by&nbsp;</span><i>Rats!</i><span>&nbsp;memoize their results, the
      primary expression is parsed exactly once. Each subsequent alternative
      simply looks up the result of the first parse.</span>
    <p>Note
      that it is possible to rewrite the production for&nbsp;<code>Suffix</code>&nbsp;to not require backtracking.
      An alternative expression, without semantic actions, might look like this:</p>
    <pre>   Primary ( Question / Star / Plus / /* Empty */ )
</pre><span>Further
      note that other top-down parsers, such as JavaCC and ANTLR, may not
      require backtracking, even with a comparable production to the one used in&nbsp;</span><i>Rats!</i><span>'
      own grammar as they support (limited) lookahead. However, the original
      form clearly and concisely expresses the intent behind this production
      and, because parsers generated by&nbsp;</span><i>Rats!</i><span>&nbsp;memoize their results, does
      not require any fiddling with lookahead (as would be necessary for other
      top-down parsers).</span>
    <p>In
      theory, packrat parsers create a two-dimensional array, with characters in
      the input stream along the x-axis and nonterminals along the y-axis. In
      practice, not all values in this array are calculated (many of them
      represent mismatched nonterminals anyway) and the array is sparse. To
      avoid allocating memory for the entire array, parsers generated by&nbsp;<i>Rats!</i>&nbsp;break each column into
      several chunks. Memory for the different chunks is allocated independently
      and on demand (i.e., if a parsing result needs to be stored). Furthermore,
      for productions that are only referenced once in the entire grammar the
      corresponding row is never allocated.</p>
    <p>Grammar
      writers have further control over memory allocation by declaring
      productions to be&nbsp;<code>transient</code>:
      if a production is transient, the corresponding row is not allocated
      either. The transient keyword can thus reduce a parser's memory footprint
      and also improve its performance. However, it is also&nbsp;<i>dangerous</i>&nbsp;because, if overused, the
      resulting parser may need to reparse the same input for the same
      nonterminal several times and thus perform in time superlinear to the size
      of the input.</p>
    <p>So,
      which productions should be declared transient? In other parsers, the
      parser processes&nbsp;<i>tokens</i>&nbsp;generated by a separate
      lexer instead of accessing the character stream directly. Packrat parser
      grammars thus need to include productions that build up tokens. Examples
      include the&nbsp;<code>Escape</code>,&nbsp;<code>HexNumber</code>, and&nbsp;<code>HexDigit</code>&nbsp;productions
      in&nbsp;<i>Rats!</i>' own
      grammar (shown&nbsp;<a  href="#transient-example">above</a>).
      Such productions can be declared transient, as the parser typically does
      not backtrack at the level of individual characters. Furthermore,
      productions that cover ignored input characters, notably all productions
      that cover white space and comments, can be declared transient as well.
      However, when in doubt, it is best to&nbsp;<i>not</i>&nbsp;declare a production as
      transient, or to perform performance studies on several inputs to see how
      such declarations impact the parser's memory footprint and performance.<a

         name="attributes"></a></p>
    <h4>Grammar
      and Production Attributes</h4>
    <i>Rats!</i><span>&nbsp;supports a number of
      options, which are either specified as a grammar-wide option in the
      top-level module's introduction or as per-production attributes:</span>
    <ul>
      <li><a  name="public-attribute"></a><code>public</code>,&nbsp;<code>protected</code>,
        and&nbsp;<code>private</code>&nbsp;instruct&nbsp;<i>Rats!</i>&nbsp;to make a production a
        top-level production, referenceable from other modules, and
        referenceable only from the same module, respectively. These attributes
        do not have values. Furthermore, these attributes can only be specified
        as per-production attributes. The default is&nbsp;<code>protected</code>&nbsp;and can be omitted from
        productions.</li>
      <li><code>transient</code>&nbsp;instructs&nbsp;<i>Rats!</i>&nbsp;not
        to memoize the corresponding production. The attribute does not have a
        value and can only be specified as a per-production attribute.</li>
      <li><code>memoized</code>&nbsp;instructs&nbsp;<i>Rats!</i>&nbsp;to
        always memoize the corresponding production. The attribute does not have
        a value and can only be specified as a per-production attribute.</li>
      <li><code>inline</code>&nbsp;instructs&nbsp;<i>Rats!</i>&nbsp;not
        to memoize the corresponding production. For productions that are
        neither void nor text-only, it also instructs&nbsp;<i>Rats!</i>&nbsp;to inline the production
        if the corresponding nonterminal appears as the only element in an
        ordered choice's alternative. The attribute does not have a value and
        can only be specified as a per-production attribute.</li>
      <li><code>noinline</code>&nbsp;instructs&nbsp;<i>Rats!</i>&nbsp;not
        to inline the production, even if it is (recognized as) transient. The
        attribute does not have a value and can only be specified as a
        per-production attribute.</li>
      <li><code>constant</code>&nbsp;instructs&nbsp;<i>Rats!</i>&nbsp;to
        make all bindings constant and thus unmodifiable. The attribute does not
        have a value. This attribute can be specified either as a grammar-wide
        attribute or as a per-production attribute.</li>
      <li><code>withLocation</code>&nbsp;instructs&nbsp;<i>Rats!</i>&nbsp;to
        annotate all semantic values that are instances of {@link xtc.tree.Node}
        with their locations in the source file. The attribute does not have a
        value. This attribute can be specified either as a grammar-wide
        attribute or as a per-production attribute.</li>
      <li><a  name="stateful-attribute"></a><code>stateful</code>&nbsp;instructs&nbsp;<i>Rats!</i>&nbsp;to
        include code for managing global parsing state through a {@link
        xtc.util.State state object}. This attribute is used both as a
        grammar-wide attribute and a per-production attribute. The grammar-wide
        attribute value specifies the class managing the global state (which
        must have a no-argument constructor).&nbsp;<i>Rats!</i>&nbsp;includes a static final
        field&nbsp;<code>yyState</code>,
        which references an instance of that class, in the generated parser. For
        a production with this attribute, the attribute does not have a value
        and&nbsp;<i>Rats!</i>&nbsp;includes
        the appropriate calls to {@link xtc.util.State#start()}, {@link
        xtc.util.State#commit()}, and {@link xtc.util.State#abort()}. Note that
        the state object must be reset explicitly with the per-production&nbsp;<code>resetting</code>&nbsp;attribute. Further note
        that, if a grammar spans several modules, all the module's stateful
        options must specify the same class name.</li>
      <li><code>resetting</code>&nbsp;instructs&nbsp;<i>Rats!</i>&nbsp;to
        include code to {@link xtc.util.State#reset(String) reset} the global
        state object. The attribut does not have a value. This attribute can
        only be specified as a per-production attribute and requires a
        grammar-wide&nbsp;<code>stateful</code>&nbsp;attribute.</li>
      <li><code>ignoringCase</code>&nbsp;instructs&nbsp;<i>Rats!</i>&nbsp;to
        perform comparisons for string matches in a case-insensitive manner. The
        attribute does not have a value. This attribute can be specified either
        as a grammar-wide attribute or as a per-production attribute.</li>
      <li><code>flatten</code>&nbsp;instructs&nbsp;<i>Rats!</i>&nbsp;to
        add the elements of list values (i.e., instances of {@link
        xtc.util.Pair}) to generic nodes instead of adding the list values
        themselves. This attribute does not have a value and can only be
        specified as a grammar-wide attribute.</li>
      <li><code>variant</code>&nbsp;instructs&nbsp;<i>Rats!</i>&nbsp;that
        all generic nodes returned by the production as a semantic value are
        variants of the same type. This attribute does not have a value and can
        only be specified as a per-production attribute.</li>
      <li><code>withParseTree</code>&nbsp;instructs&nbsp;<i>Rats!</i>&nbsp;to
        generate a parse tree instead of an abstract syntax tree. This attribute
        is specified as a grammar-wide attribute and does not have a value. For
        a grammar with this attribute,&nbsp;<i>Rats!</i>&nbsp;rewrites all generic,
        text-only, and void productions as well as productions that pass the
        semantic value through to preserve the input in the form of {@link
        xtc.tree.Formatting} annotations. The embedded AST generally has the
        same structure as for the grammr without the attribute. The exception
        are strings, which are represented as instances of {@link
        xtc.tree.Token}. Furthermore, generic nodes include additional children
        consisting of&nbsp;<code>Formatting</code>&nbsp;annotating&nbsp;<code>null</code>&nbsp;values if voided
        expressions or void nonterminals appear between two non-void
        repetitions.</li>
      <li><code>verbose</code>&nbsp;instructs&nbsp;<i>Rats!</i>&nbsp;to
        print debugging information to the console for each parser method
        invocation. The attribute does not have a value. This attribute can be
        specified either as a grammar-wide attribute or as a per-production
        attribute.</li>
      <li><code>nowarn</code>&nbsp;instructs&nbsp;<i>Rats!</i>&nbsp;to
        suppress warnings during parser generation. The attribute does not have
        a value; it can be specified either as a grammar-wide attribute or as a
        per-production attribute.</li>
      <li><a  name="parser-attribute"></a><code>parser</code>&nbsp;instructs&nbsp;<i>Rats!</i>&nbsp;to
        use the fully qualified class name specified by the attribute's value as
        the Java class name for the generated parser, instead of deducing that
        name from the module's name. This attribute can only be specified as a
        grammar-wide attribute.</li>
      <li><code>factory</code>&nbsp;instructs&nbsp;<i>Rats!</i>&nbsp;to
        use the (optionally qualified) class name specified by the attribute's
        value as the factory for creating generic nodes instead of using&nbsp;<code>xtc.tree.GNode</code>.
        This attribute can only be specified as a grammar-wide attribute.</li>
      <li><code>visibility</code>&nbsp;instructs&nbsp;<i>Rats!</i>&nbsp;to
        make the generated parser class either public or package private,
        depending on the attribute's value (<code>public</code>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<code>packagePrivate</code>).
        This attribute can only be specified as a grammar-wide attribute. The
        default for modules without this attribute is public.</li>
      <li><code>rawTypes</code>&nbsp;instructs&nbsp;<i>Rats!</i>&nbsp;to
        use raw types instead of generic types. Besides a "<code>@SuppressWarnings("unchecked")</code>"
        annotation for the parser class, the generated code is compatible with
        Java 1.4. The attribute does not have a value and can only be specified
        as a grammar-wide attribute.</li>
      <li><code>main</code>&nbsp;instructs&nbsp;<i>Rats!</i>&nbsp;to
        include a static main method that parses one or more input files and
        prints the corresponding results. The value of this attribute must be
        the name of the top-level nonterminal to parse. This attribute can only
        be specified as a grammar-wide attribute.</li>
      <li><code>printer</code>&nbsp;instructs&nbsp;<i>Rats!</i>&nbsp;to
        use the visitor specified by the attribute's value for printing the
        semantic value returned by a successful parse. This attribute can only
        be specified as a grammar-wide attribute and requires that the grammar
        also has the&nbsp;<code>main</code>&nbsp;attribute.</li>
      <li><a  name="set"></a><code>setOfString</code>&nbsp;instructs&nbsp;<i>Rats!</i>&nbsp;to
        include a static final set of strings with the attribute's value as its
        name.&nbsp;<i>Rats!</i>&nbsp;also includes a convience
        method for filling sets&nbsp;<code>add(Set,T[])</code>.
        This attribute can only be specified as a grammar-wide attribute.</li>
      <li><a  name="flag"></a><code>flag</code>&nbsp;instructs&nbsp;<i>Rats!</i>&nbsp;to
        include a public static final boolean field with the attribute's value
        as its name. The field's value is&nbsp;<code>true</code>.
        This attribute can only be specified as a grammar-wide attribute.</li>
      <li><code>genericAsVoid</code>&nbsp;instructs&nbsp;<i>Rats!</i>&nbsp;to
        treat generic productions as void productions. The attribute does not
        have a value and can only be specified as a grammar-wide attribute.</li>
      <li><code>dump</code>&nbsp;instructs&nbsp;<i>Rats!</i>&nbsp;to
        include a method for dumping a plain-text representation of the parser's
        memoization table to a printer:&nbsp;<code>dump({@link
          xtc.tree.Printer})</code>. The attribute does not have a value and can
        only be specified as a grammar-wide attribute.</li>
      <li><code>explicit</code>&nbsp;instructs&nbsp;<i>Rats!</i>&nbsp;to
        always generate an explicit error for the production instead of reusing
        parse errors where possible. The attribute does not have a value and can
        only be specified as a per-production attribute.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Parser
      Actions</h4>
    <span>Some
      languages cannot be expressed by PEGs or&nbsp;</span><i>Rats!</i><span>&nbsp;grammars. For example, the
      on-the-wire format for&nbsp;</span><a

       href="http://world.std.com/%7Ecme/html/spki.html">SPKI/SDSI</a><span>&nbsp;represents byte strings as
      one or more digits, followed by a colon, followed by the number of
      characters specified by the sequence of digits (when interpreted as a
      decimal integer); but parsing a specific number of characters cannot be
      expressed by PEGs. Parser actions allow grammar writers to still use&nbsp;</span><i>Rats!</i><span>&nbsp;for such languages by
      providing a low-level extensibility mechanism.</span>
    <p>Parser
      actions work as follows. Before executing the code in a parser action, the
      variable&nbsp;<code>yyBase</code>&nbsp;is assigned the index of the
      current parser position. The parser action can then use this index
      together with the parser's methods to further consume the input, parsing
      the expression not expressible by PEGs. When finished, it assigns the
      corresponding result to&nbsp;<code>yyResult</code>,
      which must either be a {@link xtc.parser.SemanticValue} object indicating
      a successful parse or a {@link xtc.parser.ParseError} object indicating a
      parse error. In the case of a semantic value object, that object's
      semantic value becomes the semantic value of the production, unless
      another action after the parser action changes it.</p>
    <p>The
      following grammar illustrates the use of a parser action for parsing byte
      strings as used by SPKI/SDSI. Note that the&nbsp;<code>yyStart</code>&nbsp;reference in the parser
      action is the parser position at the beginning of the production and is
      used for indicating the position of an error.</p>
    <pre>module ByteString;

body {
  Result parseChars(String number, int start, int base) throws IOException {
    int n;

    try {
      n = Integer.parseInt(number);
    } catch (NumberFormatException x) {
      return new ParseError("Malformed length", start);
    }
    
    StringBuilder buf = new StringBuilder(n);
    for (int i=0; i&lt;n; i++) {

      } else {
